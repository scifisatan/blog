Sometimes the words said by other person sticks in my brain

Sometimes it reminds me of my insecurities  
But sometimes it makes me smile endlessly  
Sometimes it makes me feel glad that they noticed  
But sometimes my heart gets terrified by the fact that they noticed

These words that are stuck, reminds me to grow everyday  
The same words also reminds me to stay at ground now and then  
These words also tell me that itâ€™s okay not to be okay  
These words also calms me down when thoughts start to rule my brain
