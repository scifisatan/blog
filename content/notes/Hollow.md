title: "Hollow"
---
I am living off those memories that we made  
I am yearning for more memories to be made  
I’m alone but I’ve got you in my mind  
I’m too drawn I’ve got nowhere to reside

Everyday, I let a piece of my heart die  
Even if I don’t want to I just can’t decide  
Whether I would like to be selfish or desperate  
Or maybe I just can’t be bothered to try it

Giving in would be a sacrifice for me  
My heart is too fragile to risk it all in  
The last thing I’d do is to push you away  
But I seem to be doing it unintentionally

It is now proceeding with a dent in my heart  
The waves of sorrow hit me from the moment I start  
It’ll scoop out a part of me every passing second  
I’ll just sit there watch myself becoming more alien

Maybe then I could say that you took all form me  
Cause I’d have nothing, everything was you from the beginning  
Empty from within and outside, no reason to continue  
But even there’s no chance, I’d still come back to you
