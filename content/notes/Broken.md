title: "Broken"
---
You’re dead inside.  
But are you okay outside either!?  
Dead eyes with broken soul  
Wondering when you’ll meet her

What am I even sad for?  
Broken bonds!?  
Broken promises!?  
Broken expectations!?  
or just the fact that it’s all over!

The feeling that I’m getting  
is making me shiver to the core  
And my hands are getting numb  
cause you’re not holding it anymore

I was begging for you  
giving you all the love that i had  
giving away my pride  
in return was a single thing that i asked  
To make me feel loved  
but even that was too much to ask
