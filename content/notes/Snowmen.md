title: "Snowmen"
---
My mind…  
Why is it always in a cold place  
It’s snowing ashes of dark thoughts  
The weather in here is so uncertain

My mind makes up a snowball  
But you’ll never know when  
It rolls all over my mind  
and forms multiple snowmen

These snowmen seems cute outside  
But only I know the weight I’m carrying  
It is stuffed with negativity inside  
Now I’m numb to this coldness

These crowd of snowmen  
could be the place for my grave  
These crowd will be the ones  
to spend my last time with
