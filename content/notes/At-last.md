So is this how it’s all gonna end?  
Silence and shy away with the tension in the air  
We lock out hearts, while we still pretend  
With the agony also comes the irony of the pain

Heavy, things that i haven’t let it out  
Scary, cause I don’t wanna lose it all  
Silent, I’m sure that this is what I deserve  
Crying, there’s no other way to make it stop

I’m seeking, something you won’t ever know  
Or maybe it’s all an act just to keep the troll  
My belief stumbles crumbles into pieces  
But to you, I’m only trying to seek revenge

I’m watching as it is falling with grace  
Pieces into infinite, numbness in the face  
I don’t need the hope, break my heart instead  
Waiting for the worst is worse than the worst itself
