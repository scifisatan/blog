title: "Why"
---
How insignificant i have become  
How little control i had over myself  
How everything felt magical one day  
How I was happy being in her grace  
  
How much had I drowned in the illusion  
How I fooled myself ignoring those signs  
How slowly we were drifting apart  
How I was hypnotized by those eyes  
  
I hate to say it but i guess  
This will be a chapter of the story of my life
