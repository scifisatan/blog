title: "Delusional"
---
Our universe had always been different  
I was just only trying to merge them  
Our, whatever we had, has been like a sea shore  
A line where we come together but also seperate

The red string that ties us has been getting loose  
I wonder about this red only to get confused  
My fingers has bled a lot cause of this red  
I haven’t seen yours cause our world is seperate

I still don’t see any bridge coming from there  
But I’m not sure if the bridge will quite fit here  
I don’t want to break what I’ve built till now  
I don’t want the cities of my world to drown

I definitely won’t let go of the things that I hold  
Things I hold dear keeps me in ground  
Maybe in future there will be a happy hug  
When there will be no seperate  
Where there will be no space between us

Maybe I am a pathetic delusional optimist  
But this is what keeps me from giving in  
Later I might get thrown into a darker void  
But till then I want a reason to be alive
