title: New Chapter
---
As the mysteries inside of me started to unfold  
The world started to makes sense,  
It started to form patterns that I can comprehend.  
The decievers started to uncover  
And I found comfort in places i used to hate.  
  
Funny how the world flipped 180 and it still made sense.  
I guess that's why we were told  
To wait till you be the age, you'll understand.  
But the threat is not out there,  
It's within me which I'll have to befriend.  
It has been a long journey,  
But i guess it's all part of a process.
