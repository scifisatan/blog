title: "Chaos"
---
There’s me  
And there’s someone that I wanna be  
There’s you  
And between us, there’s this reality.  
  
It’s idiotic,  
How we wish, how we hope, how we feed our greed  
But nothing works,  
Nothing goes the way we want it be ; honestly….  
  
I don’t know,  
Shall I go all out or should I give in?  
But, what’s the point!?  
What does any of this really mean?  
  
One day,  
You’re high up there claiming the world to be yours  
Another day,  
You’re on your own sitting besides your soul  
  
These feelings,  
I dwell into them, covering myself with it  
I’m not healing,  
I am sick as always, or worse, beneath my skin  
  
Help me!  
I don’t wanna leave but also i wanna get out  
Don’t leave me…  
I want you, I need you, promise me that you’ll be around  
  
I’m scared,  
All these fears are constantly coming uninvited  
I’m tired,  
I can’t keep up, couldn’t even bear the silence  
  
Though yet again  
I hope that things would get better  
Let it be idiocracy  
But I don’t wanna lose something that matters..  
To me…  
A lot…
