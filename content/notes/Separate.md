Now we’ll forget about us as we slowly drift apart  
Lying to ourselves and ringing false alarms  
We’ll be the strangers that we’re longing to be  
Fabricating the memories as nothing to relive

My heart gradually breaks as I slowly remember  
What it meant to me, what was it meant to be  
My heart felt everything but my mind questions  
My life becomes pointless as I slowly remember

When do we be honest and tell we’re not alike  
Is this what fine is or we’re just pretending to be fine  
Time passes by but courage never comes up  
To say the words my heart felt but my mind denies

What’s genuine is left now to begin with  
Am i doing all this to protect myself  
My doubts puts my mind in the shadow  
I remain where i was while i become more hollow
