title: "Would you"
---
I wonder if you care  
Does my slightest affect you in any way?  
Would you have felt anything?  
If i were to leave you the other day…

I wonder if you’ll ever listen  
My silent screams cries in your name  
Would you ever wanna hear?  
The things I’ve always wanted to say…

I wonder if you’ve ever felt  
The ache in your heart because of/for me?  
I am trying to hold everything together  
But i wonder if I’m just pushing you away

I’ve always wondered but I never asked  
I doubted myself; thought it’s all in my head  
But even if I shared all these things with you  
I wonder if you’d care
