title: "Anhedonia"
---
I try hard holding onto things that I’m losing  
I grieve for things that I didn’t have to begin with  
I guess my flaw is to give my attention to things I lack  
But my mistake is to not appreciating things I already have  
It is hard to carry around this pessimistic brain  
It always reminds me how bad the situation is right now and how worse it could get  
It’s hard to get happy knowing that you’ll get sad eventually  
It’s sad that I hate being sad but couldn’t enjoy while I’m happy
