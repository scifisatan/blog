title: "Uncertain"

Why’s my fate so uncertain  
Why does always life has to happen  
I always feared the extremes of life  
I was content living a lie

But  
She recently taught me  
That i can be happy while it lasts  
Being happy isn’t a crime  
As long as you’re loyal to your feelings  
You won’t be guilty no matter the time

But why does life has to happen  
Why can’t I blame it  
Why do I have to accept the way it is  
Why don’t life happen the way i want it to be

No matter how you cope  
And no matter how much you learn to hope  
Life always happens  
But why?
